# Short.en

### Short.en is a URL shortener that I built in 1 day as a day-long solo project for Dev Bootcamp.

In creating Short.en, I used Ruby, HTML5, CSS3 and a postgres database (with the pg gem). I also utilized Sinatra, a DSL for creating Ruby web applications.

#### Thoughts

Short.en was the first project that I built on my own from the ground up. As such, I am very proud of this project, despite knowing that I would have built it differently if I built this project again.

#### What I Would Change

I think I would like to someday attempt to recreate Short.en as a one-page Rails app, utilizing AJAX calls (at the very least to update click count, and for one-page aspect) and manipulating the DOM with jQuery (contemplating using jQuery in conjunction with animate.css to make the login and registration boxes shake when an error occurs).

For what it is, it doesn't really need a lot of flair, but it's also due to its simplicity that I think it would make for a fairly nice environment to further my knowledge of what I can accomplish.
